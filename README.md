This medical store management system will provide us the gievn informations,
- Dashboard : For showing the home page of the system
- Inventory : To show the amount of medicines stored
- Suppliers : Name of the suppliers
- Employees : Details of the employees working in the store
- Customers : Details of the customers
- Invoice details : provides the invoice details to the admin
- Sold Product details : Viewing the details of the products which were sold
- Reports : In Stock Medicines, Total profit etc.

### Set Up to run this system in your PC/Laptop :
- Download the XAMPP Control server of latest version and install it.
- Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP server
- Download the codebase as a zip file from this repository and extract the files in the xampp/htdocs folder in your C drive.
- Now open any web browser and visit the url : `localhost/phpmyadmin`
- Create a Database in the MYSQL server and import the `pharmacy.sql` file in the newly created database.
- Now in another tab go to the url : `localhost/Pharmacy-Management-System-master/PHARMACY/mainpage.php`
